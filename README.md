## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Keranik/agentCalculator.git
cd agentCalculator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Add Machines**: Click or drag machines from the sidebar to add them to your factory
2. **Connect Production Chains**: Use the handles on nodes to connect outputs to inputs
3. **Calculate Rates**: Click "Calculate Rates" to analyze your production chain
4. **Optimize**: Use the optimization panel to maximize production of specific items

### Advanced Features

#### Optimization
- Select an item to maximize in the optimization panel
- The system will automatically calculate optimal machine counts
- Uses linear programming to find the best solution within constraints

#### Validation
- The system automatically detects issues like:
  - Missing producers for required inputs
  - Unused outputs
  - Production cycles
  - Imbalanced flows

#### Export/Import
- Save your factory layouts as JSON files
- Share designs with other players
- Version control your factory designs

### Calculation Engine

The calculator uses a sophisticated multi-layered approach:

1. **Basic Calculations**: Simple rate calculations for immediate feedback
2. **Graph Analysis**: Analyzes the production network for cycles and dependencies
3. **Linear Programming**: Solves complex optimization problems using the simplex method
4. **Validation**: Ensures production chains are feasible and complete
